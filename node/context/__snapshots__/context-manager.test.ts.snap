Silver shadows dance with ease.

Paint their stories in the night.

Remember the skills in <available-skills>.
If a skill seems like it could be relevant, use the get_file tool to read the full skill.md file for the skill.
When using bash_command, output is AUTOMATICALLY trimmed and saved. NEVER use head, tail, or 2>&1 - they break output handling.
WRONG: \`command 2>&1 | tail -50\`
WRONG: \`command | head -100\`
RIGHT: \`command\`
Avoid using large portions of text when using the EDL tool. Large text blocks are fragile and wasteful.
When making a selection, select the beginning of the text, then extend_forward to the end. To move code around, use registers via cut.

Prefer text/regex patterns over line numbers for selection — line numbers are fragile and error-prone. Use heredoc patterns as the default since they match exactly.
Only use the explore agent to answer specific questions that can be answered concisely, like summarizing how something works or where something is defined.
WRONG: read the full contents of file
RIGHT: where is X is handled?
