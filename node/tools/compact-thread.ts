This tool extracts specific portions of the conversation history that are directly relevant to the user's next prompt.

First, provide a section where you analyze the conversation:

1. ANALYZE THE USER'S NEXT PROMPT:
   - Carefully examine what the user is asking for in their next prompt
   - Identify key technical concepts, files, functions, or problems they're focusing on
   - Determine what information from the thread directly relates to these specific elements

2. RELEVANCE:
   - Note technical decisions, code patterns, and architectural choices that impact the next prompt
   - Track the evolution of solutions and approaches that inform the upcoming work
   - Extract ONLY information that directly supports addressing the next prompt
   - Exclude general discussions not specifically relevant to the next task
   - Focus on actionable technical details needed for the next prompt

Then, provide the context section:
- Begin with the most critical information needed for the next task
- Keep code snippets minimal - only include what's absolutely necessary for the next prompt
- Reference file paths and function names rather than including implementations. NEVER include full file contents
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT include the user's next prompt in the summary - it will be automatically included

Remember: The goal is NOT to summarize the thread, but to extract ONLY the specific pieces that directly support addressing the user's next prompt.

<example>
user: compact this thread. My next prompt will be: "fix the authentication bug in the login component"

assistant:
# analysis
[consider the users next prompt]
[review the conversation so far, and decide what is the most relevant]

# context
[detailed description of only the relevant pieces]
